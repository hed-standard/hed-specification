HED version: v1.6.1-restruct

'''Syntax'''  

HED tags can only be separated by commas. Use semicolons (;) instead of commas in event descriptions since otherwise extra commas could confuse HED parsers.  Do not use single or double quotes in HED tags.
From version 2.2, HED adheres to http://semver.org/ versioning. 

HED 3 introduces the notion of the scope of an event. Events are assumed to occur at a single point in time unless they have an explicit scope. Events with a scope have a starting point and an ending point. Tools treat tags associated with scoped events as being applicable during the entire scope of that event and will automatically apply those tags to every event within the scope during analysis.  

There are four ways to define the scope of an event.  The most common method is to specify the start and end of the scope using Onset and Offset. An event tagged with Attribute/Temporal/Onset is assumed to have a scope that starts at the time associated with the Onset event and ends at the end of the dataset. To explicitly specify both the start and end of a scope gtoup the Attribute/Temporal/Onset with an Attribute/Informational/Label/# tag to identify  and mark the start of the scope along with all of the other tags associated with the scope. Use the Attribute/Temporal/Offset with the same Attribute/Informational/Label/# to indicate the end of that scope. Once a scope has been identified, additional occurences of that scope can be marked with labeled onset-offset pairs without repeating the additional tags associated with the scope. Finally, tags grouped with the Attribute/Temporal/Duration/# tag define a scope that starts at that point and ends  duration time later. One can also combine the /Attribute/Informational/Definition  and the Attribute/Informational/Label/#  with a group of tags. That label tag can then be used anywhere to represent the associated group of tags, much like an event code.

'''Event''' 
* Sensory presentation event<nowiki> [Something perceivable by the participant.]</nowiki>

* Participant action <nowiki>[Any motor action engaged in by the participant.]</nowiki>
** Task-related action {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[A task-related action taken by a participant in response to task demands, such as making a button press in response to a Sensory presentation event or tapping out a rhythm following a Condition cue presentation.]</nowiki>
** Non task-related action {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[A non-task-related action taken by the participant -- for example yawning, shifting in their chair, or responding to an Environmental event]</nowiki>
* Data feature <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event derived from the data itself, possibly inserted in a post-hoc fashion, for example an interictal spike or alpha burst.]</nowiki>
* Experimental control <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event pertaining to the control of the experiment during its operation.]</nowiki>
** Instruction <nowiki>[Experimenter (or experimental control application) gives an instruction to the participant.]</nowiki>
** Pause <nowiki>[An event indicating a stop in recording. Use (Attribute/Temporal/Onset, Attribute/Temporal/Duration) or Attribute/Temporal/Onset and, in another Event, Attribute/Temporal/Offset to specify the length of the pause.]</nowiki>    
** Timesync <nowiki>[A marker value or pattern inserted into the recorded data to allow post hoc synchronization of concurrently recorded data streams.]</nowiki>
** Procedure <nowiki>[An event marking the Onset or Offset of an experimental procedure, for example doing a saliva swab on the person, during the experiment. Use Attribute/Temporal/Onset and, in another Event, Attribute/Temporal/Offset to specify the start and end of the procedure. Use Attribute/ID/Index/# to designate a procedure identifier.]</nowiki>  
** Mishap <nowiki> {extensionAllowed} [Unplanned disruptive event such as an equipment or experiment control abnormality or experimenter error.]</nowiki>
* Experimental structure <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event describing the structure of the experiment.]</nowiki>
** Context <nowiki>[An event describing the overall environment and setup of the experiment or a portion of the experiment. This event is often inserted into a recording at the beginning of an experimental record to describe information such as whether the experiment is conducted indoors or outdoors or whether the experiment is conducted in the real-world or in a controlled laboratory setting. Tags specifying subject metadata might also be included. ]</nowiki>
** Condition <nowiki>[An event used to indicate a shift to a new experimental or task condition, usually as the result of the change of a control variable or the participant state.]</nowiki>
** Block <nowiki>[An event used to indicate a particular organizational part in the experimental design or plan. Usually the Block tag is used with scoping tags as well as tags describing what the block represents to assist with downstream analysis.]</nowiki>

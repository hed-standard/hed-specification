HED version: v1.6.0-restruct

'''Syntax'''  

HED tags can only be separated by commas. Use semicolons (;) instead of commas in event descriptions since otherwise extra commas could confuse HED parsers.  
From version 2.2, HED adheres to http://semver.org/ versioning.

'''Event''' 
* Category <nowiki>{required, requireChild, position=1} [This is meant to designate the basic nature of the event. Every event should have at least one category, but might have multiple categories.] </nowiki> 
** Sensory presentation <nowiki> [Something perceivable by the participant.]</nowiki>
*** Experimental <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [Primary category for task-or-condition-related stimulus events.]</nowiki>
*** Environmental <nowiki>{extensionAllowed}[An unplanned or environment-determined event occurring in the participant’s environment, for example, a change in experimental context such as beginning to walk on dirt versus sidewalk or a loud noise occurring in the next room.]</nowiki> 
** Participant action <nowiki>[Any motor action engaged in by the participant.]</nowiki>
*** Task-related {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[A task-related action taken by a participant in response to task demands, such as making a button press in response to a Sensory presentation event or tapping out a rhythm following a Condition cue presentation.]</nowiki>
*** Non task-related {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[A non-task-related action taken by the participant -- for example yawning, shifting in their chair, or responding to an Environmental event]</nowiki>
** Data feature <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event derived from the data itself, possibly inserted in a post-hoc fashion, for example an interictal spike or alpha burst.]</nowiki>
** Experiment Control <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event pertaining to the setup and/or control of the experiment.]</nowiki>
*** Condition <nowiki>[An event used to indicate a shift to a new experimental and/or task condition. Use {Temporal/Onset, Temporal/Duration} or {Temporal/Onset} and, in another Event, {Temporal/Offset} to specify start and end. Use {ID/Index/#} to designate a condition identifier.]</nowiki>
*** Instruction <nowiki>[Experimenter (or experimental control application) gives an instruction to the participant.]</nowiki>
*** Pause <nowiki>[An event indicating a stop in recording. Use {Temporal/Onset, Temporal/Duration} or {Temporal/Onset} and, in another Event, {Temporal/Offset} to specify the length of the pause.]</nowiki>    
*** Timesync <nowiki>[A marker value or pattern inserted into the recorded data to allow post hoc synchronization of concurrently recorded data streams.]</nowiki>
*** Procedure <nowiki>[An event marking the Onset or Offset of an experimental procedure, for example doing a saliva swab on the person, during the experiment. Use {Temporal/Onset} and, in another Event, {Temporal/Offset} to specify the start and end of the procedure. Use {ID/Index/#} to designate a procedure identifier.]</nowiki>  
*** Mishap <nowiki> {extensionAllowed} [Unplanned disruptive event such as an equipment or experiment control abnormality or experimenter error.]</nowiki>
* Description <nowiki>{requireChild, required, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=3}[Human-readable text description of the event.]</nowiki> 
** <nowiki># {takesValue}</nowiki> 
* Label <nowiki>{requireChild, required, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=0} [A label for the event with less than 20 characters, for example, 'Event/Label/Accept button press'. Please note that the information in this tag is provided for analyst guidance in referring to this and similar events in the context of the study, rather than for direct use in the analysis process. Please use tag stem Event/Category/Custom to define custom event description hierarchies not meant for inclusion in this main HED schema. Also, please do not use the words 'Onset' or 'Offset' in the Event/Label. These should only be placed in {Temporal/Onset} and {Temporal/Offset} attribute descriptors. This makes it easier to automatically find onsets and offsets for the same event.]</nowiki> 
** <nowiki># {takesValue}</nowiki> 
* Long label <nowiki>{requireChild, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=2} [A longer (than 20 characters) label for the event that may contain ‘|’ characters as separators. Long names are used to encode detailed information in a single string such as Scenario | VehiclePassing | TravelLaneBLocked | Onset].</nowiki> 
** <nowiki># {takesValue}</nowiki>

This is to differentiate the resulting group with Participant/Effect which specifies the actual effect on the participant. For example, in an RSVP experiment if an image is intended to be perceived as a target, (Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, Attribute/Intended effect) group is added. If the image was perceived by the subject as a target (e.g. they pressed a button to indicate so), then the tag Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target is also added: Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, (Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, Attribute/Intended effect). otherwise the Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target tag is not included outside of the group.]</nowiki>

Usage example:  Event/Category/Experimental stimulus/Instruction, (Action/Fixate, Attribute/Instruction) ]</nowiki>
* Participant indication <nowiki> [This tag is placed in events of type Event/Category/Participant response and grouped with Participant/Effect/Cognitive/.. tags to specify the type of cognitive effect the participant has experienced.

'''Attribute Definitions:'''
* default <nowiki>[Tag assumed to be present if not explicitly given.]</nowiki> 
* defaultUnits <nowiki>[Default units for a tag.]</nowiki> 
* extensionAllowed <nowiki>[Users can add unlimited levels of child nodes under this tag.]</nowiki> 
* isNumeric <nowiki>[The tag "#" must be replaced by a numerical value.]</nowiki> 
* position <nowiki>[Used to specify the order of the required and recommended tags in canonical order for display. The position attribute value should be an integer and the order can start at 0 or 1. Required or recommended tags without this attribute or with negative position will be shown after the others in canonical ordering.]</nowiki> 
* predicateType <nowiki> [One of propertyOf, subclassOf, passThrough -- used to facilitate mapping to OWL or RDF.]</nowiki>  
* recommended  <nowiki>[A HED string tagging an event is recommended to include this tag.]</nowiki> 
* requireChild  <nowiki>[One of its descendants must be chosen to tag an event.]</nowiki> 
*  required <nowiki>[Every HED string tagging an event should include this tag.]</nowiki>
* SIUnit  <nowiki>[Designates the name of an SI unit so it can be modified by multiple and submultiple names. Note that some units such as byte are designated as SI units although they are not part of the standard.]</nowiki>
* SIUnitModifier <nowiki>[SI unit modifier indicating a multiple or submultiple of a base unit.]</nowiki> 
* SIUnitSymbolModifier <nowiki>[SI unit symbol modifier indicating a multiple or submultiple of a base unit symbol.]</nowiki> 
* takesValue <nowiki>[This tag will have a "#" placeholder child in the schema which is expected to be replaced with a user-defined value.] </nowiki> 
* unique <nowiki>[Only one of this tag or its descendants can be used within a single tag group or event.]</nowiki> 
* unitSymbol <nowiki>[Abbreviation or symbol representing a type of unit. Unit symbols  represent both the singular and the plural and thus cannot be pluralized.]</nowiki>

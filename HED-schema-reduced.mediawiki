HED version: v1.5.0-restruct

'''Syntax'''  

HED tags can only be separated by commas. Use semicolons (;) instead of commas in event descriptions since otherwise extra commas could confuse HED parsers.  
From version 2.2, HED adheres to http://semver.org/ versioning.

'''Event''' 
* Category <nowiki>{required, requireChild, position=1} [This is meant to designate the reason this event was recorded. Every event should have at least one category, but may have multiple categories.] </nowiki> 
** Sensory presentation <nowiki> [Something that can be perceived.]</nowiki>
*** Experimental <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [Primary category for time-locked stimulus events.]</nowiki>
*** Environmental <nowiki>{extensionAllowed}[An environmental event, for example, a change in experimental context such as walking on dirt versus sidewalk or a loud noise in the next room.]</nowiki> 
** Participant action <nowiki>[Any action engaged in by the participant.]</nowiki>
*** Task-related {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[An action taken by a participant in response to an experimental event.]</nowiki>
*** Incidental {extensionAllowed} <nowiki>[A non-task-related action taken by the participant -- for example yawning, standing up during a seated experiment, or responding to a loud noise unrelated to the experiment.]</nowiki>
** Data feature <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event derived from the data itself, possibly inserted in a post-hoc fashion.]</nowiki>
** Experiment Control <nowiki>{extensionAllowed} [An event pertaining to setup and/or control of the experiment.]</nowiki>
*** Condition <nowiki>[An event used to indicate an experimental condition. Use Attribute/Temporal/Onset and Attribute/Temporal/Offset to specify start and end. Use Attribute/ID/Index/# to designate an identifier of the condition.]</nowiki>
*** Instruction <nowiki>[Give an instruction to the participant .]</nowiki>
*** Pause <nowiki>[An event indicating a stop in recording. Use Attribute/Temporal/Onset and Attribute/Temporal/Duration to specify the length of the pause.]</nowiki>    
*** Procedure <nowiki>[An event marking an experimental procedure, for example doing a saliva swab on the person, during the experiment. Use Attribute/Temporal/Onset and Attribute/Temporal/Offset to specify start and end. Use Attribute/ID/Index/# to designate an identifier of the condition.]</nowiki>  
*** Sync <nowiki>[An event used for synchronizing data streams.]</nowiki>
*** Technical mishap <nowiki> {extensionAllowed} [Experimenters forgot to turn on something or the cord snagged and something may be wrong with the data.]</nowiki>
 
* Description <nowiki>{requireChild, required, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=3}[Same as HED 1.0 description for human-readable text]</nowiki> 
** <nowiki># {takesValue}</nowiki> 
* Label <nowiki>{requireChild, required, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=0} [A label for the event that is less than 20 characters. For example /Label/Accept button. Please note that the information under this tag is primarily not for use in the analysis and is provided for the convenience in referring to events in the context of a single study. Please use Custom tag to define custom event hierarchies. Please do not mention the words Onset or Offset in the label. These should only be placed in Attribute/Temporal/Onset  and Attribute/Temporal/Offset.  Software automatically generates a final label with (onset) or (offset) in parentheses added to the original label. This makes it easier to automatically find onsets and offsets for the same event.]</nowiki> 
** <nowiki># {takesValue}</nowiki> 
* Long name <nowiki>{requireChild, unique, predicateType=propertyOf, position=2} [A long name for the event that could be over 100 characters and could contain characters like vertical bars as separators. Long names are used for cases when one wants to encode a lot of information in a single string such as  Scenario | VehiclePassing | TravelLaneBLocked | Onset].</nowiki>

* Intended effect <nowiki>[This tag is to be grouped with Participant/Effect/Cognitive to specify the intended cognitive effect (of the experimenter). This is to differentiate the resulting group with Participant/Effect which specifies the actual effect on the participant. For example, in an RSVP experiment if an image is intended to be perceived as a target, (Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, Attribute/Intended effect) group is added. If the image was perceived by the subject as a target (e.g. they pressed a button to indicate so), then the tag Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target is also added: Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, (Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target, Attribute/Intended effect). otherwise the Participant/Effect/Cognitive/Target tag is not included outside of the group.]</nowiki>

* Participant indication <nowiki> [This tag is placed in events of type Event/Category/Participant response and grouped with Participant/Effect/Cognitive/.. tags to specify the type of cognitive effect the participant has experienced.

'''HED'''  <nowiki> {requireChild} [Hierarchical Event Descriptor]</nowiki> 
* <nowiki># {takesValue, isNumeric} [HED specification version number: normally there is no need to specify the version number in the HED string since it will be matched by default to the most recent compliant version, but this tag can be used to specify the exact HED version the HED string was based on.]</nowiki>
